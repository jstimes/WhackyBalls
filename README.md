# WhackyBalls
An Android OpenGL ES game utilizing device sensors.

Users rotate their device to roll a ball along different directions on a platform. The goal is to knock others off while keeping your ball on the platform. 

Currently the game is just a prototype. There are AI balls that use some simple path planning to attempt to knock the user's ball off. In the future I hope to make some more sophisticated AI, more eye-catching backgrounds/colors, and a networking component where users can play against friends in real-time.
